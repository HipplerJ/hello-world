Week 3
Assignment: GitHub Hello World
Due: April 22, 2018

Purpose: 
In this assignment, you will learn about GitHub, currently the most popular code hosting platform. You will create and use a repository, start a new branch, make changes to a file and push them to GitHub as commits, and will open and merge a pull request. If all that sounds strange to you, it's fine. This is intended to give you hands-on experience with GitHub.
